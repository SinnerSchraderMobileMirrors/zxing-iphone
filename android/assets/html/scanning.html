<h3><center>How To Scan</center></h3>
<p>Scanning a barcode is fast and easy. <b>Barcode Scanner</b> continuously scans the viewfinder
  rectangle, so there's no need to press the shutter button. Just move the phone until the barcode
  is completely inside:</p>

<p>If you're having trouble, make sure to hold the phone steady. If the camera is unable to focus,
  try moving further back from the barcode.</p>
<p>When a barcode is found, the phone will beep and take you to the results screen, which describes
  what you found, and offers a choice of actions. Learn more:</p>
